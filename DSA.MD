# way to organize data so that we can use this data effciently

example:

[8,2,3,4,5,212]
[2,3,4,5,8,212]

- Data Structure:

  -- primitive data structure
  -- integer , flot , character, pointer

  -- non primitive data structure:
  -- array,list,files

      ---list:
          -- linear list and non linear list
               --- linear list is stack and queues
                 --- non linear list graphs and trees
